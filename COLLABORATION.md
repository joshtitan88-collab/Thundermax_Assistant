# COLLABORATION.md — Thundermax Tuning Assistant (primary path)

This is the primary coordination document for the project. Any AI or human
picking up this project starts here.

## What this project is

A local tuning assistant for Joshua's **2023 Harley-Davidson Low Rider ST,
131ci, 2-into-1 exhaust, ThunderMax TBW ECM**. It:

1. **Parses `.tbw` tune files** (`src/thundermax_parser.py`) — validates
   integrity, extracts the base-map ID, diffs two tunes region-by-region,
   generates markdown decode reports, and indexes whole folders of tunes.
2. **Answers tuning questions locally** (`src/tune_assistant.py`) — an
   Ollama-backed chat/Q&A grounded in the shop's tuning documentation from
   the NAS brain_vault, plus an `analyze` mode that explains what changed
   between two tunes in rider terms.

## Provenance

- The original effort ran through Grok and ChatGPT ("Throttle Logic")
  sessions in Aug–Sep 2025. Those sessions produced the tuning docs, tune
  cards, ride packets, and one decode report — but **no source code
  survived** to the NAS. See `HANDOFF_FROM_GROK.md` for what was recovered.
- This codebase was rebuilt from those artifacts on 2026-07-11 by Claude
  (Claude Code), reverse-engineering the TBW format from real tune files.

## Where the data lives

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Tune files (`.tbw`, ~30) | `/mnt/nas/ADMIN/LOCAL NAS/THROTTLE LOGIC/` |
| Tuning manuals & guides | `/mnt/nas/ADMIN/LOCAL NAS/THROTTLE LOGIC/TMAX TUNING MANUAL/` |
| AI project docs (ride packet, tune card, templates) | `/mnt/nas/ADMIN/LOCAL NAS/NEWER IPAD 16SEP2025/Thundermax AI Project/` |
| Searchable markdown corpus (37+ docs) | `/mnt/nas/ADMIN/brain_vault/` (files matching `*thundermax*` / `*thunder_max*`) |
| Prior decode report (format reference) | `.../TMAX TUNING MANUAL/FINALALLAROUNDGOODTUNEVatlV2_decode_report.md` |

## TBW format — what we know so far

- All observed files are exactly **214470 bytes**.
- Header: four LE u32 at 0x00 (`0x87, 0x4000, 0x1, 0x147` in every sample).
- **Base-map ID** at `0x10`: one length byte (0x10=16) + 16 ASCII chars
  (e.g. `HYSSPVCAHN051320`, `HXSSEDCAAN06161…`, `ZZSSQXETDN100720`).
  This is the only ASCII string in the file.
- `0x21`–`~0x3C0`: per-section metadata/checksums (these bytes churn
  whenever *any* table changes).
- Beyond `~0x3C0`: table data. Cells are little-endian fields on a **4- or
  8-byte stride** (a value word often paired with a flag/limit word) — *not*
  a densely packed grid, so the earlier "16-byte-stride u16 (value,flag)
  pairs" description was an oversimplification. **AutoTune correction cells
  are signed**, so small negative trims appear in a raw byte diff as
  `0x0000 → 0xFFxx` borrows.
- **Table map (NEW):** `src/tables.json` + `src/table_map.py` locate and name
  the major bands (AFR target, AFR/VE pages, fuel pages, timing map, timing
  limit array, fuel/rich correction, autotune-learned, metadata) with a
  confidence tier each, derived by differential analysis of semantically
  labeled tune pairs. See "Table map" below.
- **Timing scale:** the global −1° edit shifted every cell of the
  `0xC3C9` timing-limit array by exactly −49 raw → **~49 raw units per
  degree** (34°×49 = 1666). Medium confidence: measured on that array, and
  *assumed* (not yet proven) for the main RPM×TPS timing map.
- **Per-cell engineering-unit scaling is still unconfirmed for most tables.**
  Diff analysis locates *where* each table lives and *what category* it is,
  but exact axis order and unit scale need one TMax Tuner ground-truth
  reading per band — the top remaining open task.

## House tuning rules (from validated shop history)

- AutoTune learning gates: **enable >200°F, disable >280°F**; cold-start and
  heat-soak trims are garbage — block them.
- Decel pop protocol: closed-throttle 4000→2000 rpm decels in 3rd/4th.
  Pops above 4k → **+2% VE @ 0–2% TPS, 3840–4608 rpm**. Broad-range pops →
  **−1° spark @ 0–2% TPS, 2048–2816 rpm**.
- Always log TPS, RPM, AFR target vs actual, CHT, trims.
- Every tune change gets a validation ride + tune report
  (template in the Thundermax AI Project folder).

## Table map

`src/tables.json` is the frozen band map; `src/table_map.py` reads it and:

- `python3 table_map.py bands` — list every named band + confidence.
- `python3 table_map.py classify A.tbw B.tbw` — label the changed regions of a
  diff and roll them up by category (TIMING / AFR / FUEL / AUTOTUNE / …).
- `python3 table_map.py derive <tune_folder>` — recompute per-band evidence
  from the labeled tune pairs so the JSON stays auditable, not magic.

`thundermax_parser.py compare` now also prints a **table** column and a
per-category byte summary, using this map when it's importable (degrades
gracefully if `tables.json` is absent). Confidence tiers: **high** = band
isolated cleanly to one intent across independent pairs; **medium** =
one-sided evidence; **low** = churns on every edit (autotune/checksum). Treat
medium/low bands as *located but not cell-accurate*.

## Current state (2026-07-12)

- [x] **`tmax` unified CLI** — one entry point for parser, table map, and
      assistant; auto-starts Ollama when needed; `tmax verify` self-check
- [x] Parser: integrity, base-map ID, header decode — tested on real tunes
- [x] Parser: region diff (`compare`) with delta stats **+ named-table labels**
- [x] Parser: decode-report generation matching the shop template
- [x] Parser: batch `scan` index of a tune folder
- [x] Assistant: Ollama-backed `ask` / `chat` / `analyze`
- [x] **`analyze` is grounded**: it feeds the LLM the *classified* diff
      (categories + confidence), not raw hex, and instructs it to describe
      only what actually changed — verified live against the global −1°
      timing pair (correctly identified; no invented features)
- [x] **Test suite**: 13 unit tests on synthetic tunes (`tests/`), no
      NAS/Ollama required; wired into `scripts/verify.sh`
- [x] Ollama on `127.0.0.1:11434`; assistant auto-routes per question:
      `qwen2.5-coder:14b` (fast, on the RTX 5060 Ti GPU) for lookups,
      `hermes3:70b` (deep-thinker, slow ~0.7 tok/s) for tuning strategy and
      `analyze`. Overrides: `--fast` / `--deep` / `--model`. (2026-07-13)
- [x] **Map table offsets to named bands** — AFR target, AFR/VE pages, fuel
      pages, timing map, timing-limit array, fuel/rich correction, autotune,
      metadata (`tables.json`, confidence-tiered)
- [~] Confirm raw→engineering scaling: timing ≈49 raw/deg (medium); other
      tables still need one TMax ground-truth cell each (see below)
- [ ] Split real map pages out of the `0x3C0–0x5132` shared-churn block with
      surgically-isolated single-table edits
- [ ] Optional: GPU accel (RTX 5060 Ti present but NVIDIA driver not installed)

### The one high-value experiment to unlock cell-accuracy

For each band flagged `needs_ground_truth` in `tables.json`: in TMax Tuner,
change exactly **one** map (e.g. AFR target only), save as a new `.tbw`, then
`table_map.py classify old.tbw new.tbw`. A single-table edit isolates that
band cleanly from checksum churn; reading one known cell value in TMax and
matching it to the raw bytes locks both the axis order and the unit scale.

## Ground rules

- **Never write to `.tbw` files.** Read-only until the format is fully
  confirmed. A corrupted flash can strand the bike.
- Anything the assistant suggests still goes through the validation-ride
  protocol before it's trusted.
- NAS paths are the source of truth for data; this repo holds code only.
