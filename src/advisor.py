"""Symptom -> corrective change. The part that knows what to DO about a tune.

Everything else in this project describes: it parses a tune, classifies a
diff, models a pull, argues about a proposal. None of it answers the question
Joshua actually has when he gets off the bike, which is "it pops on decel and
runs hot, what do I change?"

This does. It maps a described symptom to a concrete change in TMax Tuner's
own page language -- table, direction, magnitude, rpm/TPS band -- along with
what to log to confirm it, and what would prove the recommendation wrong.

THREE RULES THIS MODULE OBEYS
-----------------------------
1. EVERY recommendation is run through `guardrails.check_change()` before it
   can be returned, and anything that draws a `block` is dropped, not
   softened. The advisor is not allowed to be the thing that talks the safety
   layer into a bad change -- if the house limits will not permit the fix, the
   honest output is "no legal change", plus the reason.

2. PROVENANCE IS NOT DECORATION. The decel-pop protocol is the only remedy in
   this file that comes from validated shop history on THIS bike. Everything
   else is inference from the manuals, the timing backbone, and physics.
   Those are marked `inferred` and say so out loud, because a rider deserves
   to know which advice has been ridden and which has not.

3. NOTHING HERE IS A MEASUREMENT. There is no datalog in this project (see
   docs/corpus/thundermax_reference_2026-08-26_no-ride-data-open-loop.md), so
   every remedy is a HYPOTHESIS to be tested by the validation-ride protocol,
   never a verdict. Each one ships with the log fields that would confirm or
   refute it.

Deliberately not an LLM. A rider on the side of the road with a hot engine
should get the same answer every time, and get it with Ollama down.

            "it.' 0.00 is the documented way to switch AutoTune OFF for a "
