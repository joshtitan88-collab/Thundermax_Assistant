"""Bridge between real `.tbw` tune binaries and the deterministic virtual dyno.

Joshua's question was: *"we will also need a way to test the dyno and tune to
make sure that the dyno is thinking correctly and reading the tune correctly
when it processes it."*

`virtual_dyno.simulate_pull()` has never read a `.tbw` in its life — it takes an
ABSTRACT list of `{table, rpm_band, tps_band, direction, magnitude, unit}`
deltas. This module supplies the two missing halves:

  read_tune(path)             -- what the dyno can (and cannot) see in ONE tune
  changes_from_diff(a, b)     -- a real A->B tune diff turned into dyno changes
  self_test()                 -- runtime proof the dyno's physics is self-consistent

THE HONESTY CONSTRAINT (read this before changing anything here)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Per COLLABORATION.md, per-cell engineering-unit scaling of the TBW format is
**UNCONFIRMED for almost every table**. What is actually known:

  * WHERE each table band lives (tables.json, confidence-tiered).
  * ONE scale factor: ~49 raw units per degree, MEASURED on the 0xC3C9
    timing-limit array by a global -1 deg edit. Assumed — never proven — for
    the main RPM x TPS timing map.
  * NOTHING about the axis/cell ORDER of any band. tables.json flags every
    single band `needs_ground_truth`.

Therefore this module obeys three rules, and every function's output is shaped
by them:

  1. **No invented absolute readings.** "VE at 4000 rpm / 50% TPS = 0.92" would
     be a fabrication. read_tune() reports RAW cell statistics per band, and an
     engineering-unit estimate ONLY for a band whose scale was measured.
  2. **No fabricated bands.** tables.json contains no offset -> (rpm, tps)
     mapping for ANY band, so `rpm_band` / `tps_band` come out `null`. A wrong
     band silently mis-scopes a safety check, which is worse than no band.
     (`virtual_dyno._band()` reads a null band as "applies everywhere" — the
     conservative reading, which is what we want.)
  3. **Everything carries provenance.** confidence tier, scale basis, and an
     explicit `unknown[]` / `warnings[]` naming what could not be resolved and
     why.

WHY DELTAS ARE TRUSTED FURTHER THAN ABSOLUTES
---------------------------------------------
A uniform raw DELTA across a band survives three kinds of ignorance that an
absolute reading does not: unknown axis order, unknown cell offset within the
record, and unknown zero-point/bias. "-49 raw everywhere in the timing band" is
"-1 degree everywhere" regardless of which cell is which. "1666 raw at this
offset" is only 34.0 deg if the offset, the stride alignment AND the zero point
are all right. So:

  * changes_from_diff() converts TIMING deltas to degrees (measured basis =
    medium confidence, assumed basis = low confidence).
  * read_tune() emits an absolute engineering estimate ONLY for the one band
    where the scale was actually measured, and says so.

NEVER WRITES A `.tbw`. Reads only. (Project hard rule #2.)

Stdlib only. No network, no NAS requirement, no Ollama, no LLM.

    WHY NOT JUST thundermax_parser.region_deltas():
      region_deltas() aligns to `start - start % 2` — an even offset relative
      to the file, not to the band's record boundary. Every located band starts
      at an ODD offset (0x01989, 0x01FC9, 0x0C3C9 ...), so on a real tune that
      alignment reads each record shifted by one byte and every delta comes out
      multiplied by 256. Verified on the real global -1 deg pair: the true
      delta in timing_limit_array is -49 in all 128 records, but region_deltas
      reports -12544 (= -49 * 256). A degree figure built on that would have
      been 256x wrong.
